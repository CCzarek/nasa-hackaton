# System requirements


1. Seismographs (on probes) have to export data in a most compressed way.
2. Seismographs have to detect moon/marsquakes and send simplified information about it to stations on the Earth
3. Seismographs have to send all data about specific accidents when they are asked for that.
4. Seismographs have to be able to store seismic data from (at least) the last 10 years.
5. Seismograph software has to be fast and should not use too much energy and memory.
6. Stations on earth have to be able to receive data from seismographs all the time. 
7. Stations on the Earth have to be equipped in a software which will allow connection with seismographs
8. Software of stations on the Earth has to be able to ask seismograph for data of specific accident:
    - if data has never been already received, system should ask seismograph for data
    - if data was already received, system should not send any message to seismographs
